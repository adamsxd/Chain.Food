# Introduction

The inspiration for this project came from a chance experience the author had. 

During a hackathon competition, many participants were unable to arrive at the venue on time in the morning, resulting in a surplus of breakfast provided by the organizers. This surplus was eventually wasted as the organizers had no way of distributing it.

Later that day, while visiting a convenience store, the author noticed a large quantity of discounted food that was set to be thrown away the next morning, as per company policy.

These experiences highlight the issue of food waste in urban areas, and the author was inspired to create a decentralized application (Dapp) called Chain.Food to address this problem.

## Food Wasted Data

Data from „ÄäThe Food Waste Index Report„Äã 

by the **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)** 

suggests:

> About 93.1 billion kilograms of food is wasted globally every year, equivalent to 17% of all food produced.

> Vegetables, roots, fruits and grains are the most commonly wasted food types in households.

> Food retailers and foodservice are among the largest sources of food waste, with supermarkets, restaurants and hotels being particularly wasteful links in their supply chains.

> Reducing food waste plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as the energy and resources required to produce, transport and process food result in significant carbon emissions.

The report reveals the magnitude of the food waste problem and calls for global action to reduce it. The numbers are astonishing

## Features

### Main Features

- Chain.Food is open to all restaurants, event organizers, and individuals who wish to register.
- Users who link their wallet to the platform can view information about free food nearby, as well as publish information and location about free food they are offering.
- Upon receipt or donation of food, users will receive FoodCoin tokens as an incentive from the platform.
- Users who post photos of their empty plates after consuming the received food can also earn FoodCoin rewards.
- Tokens can be redeemed for rewards at partner merchants or traded on exchanges.

### NFTs

Users who receive or donate food for the first time will receive an NFT reward. Additionally, users who continue to donate or publish "empty plate" posts may be eligible for additional NFT rewards. The NFT serves as proof that the user has used the application to save food.

## Partnerships

Chain.Food is willing to collaborate with Layer2 service providers to airdrop partnership funds to users in the form of blockchain assets.

## Social Responsibility - Donations

Chain.Food will donate the tax revenue and some of its profits earned from users obtaining FoodCoin and minting NFTs to nonprofit organizations dedicated to donating food to underdeveloped regions and disaster-stricken areas in order to help them carry out such activities.

The ultimate goal of the project is to save at least one ton of food waste and complete 500 food exchange activities within one year of the platform's launch, while continuing to support other nonprofit organizations. The aim is to make this project sustainable and help feed those who are in need so that they will not experience hunger due to environmental factors. 

## Objectives

We aim to achieve the following objectives within one year of the project's full launch:

- Save at least one ton of food waste
- Complete 500 food exchange activities on the platform
- Continue to support other nonprofit organizations' related activities

Let's work together to make sure that more people have access to food and are not hungry due to environmental factors.
