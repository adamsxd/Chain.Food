# Introduction

The inspiration for this project came from a chance experience the author had. 

During a hackathon competition, many participants were unable to arrive at the venue on time in the morning, resulting in a surplus of breakfast provided by the organizers. This surplus was eventually wasted as the organizers had no way of distributing it.

---

Later that day, while visiting a convenience store, the author noticed a large quantity of discounted food that was set to be thrown away the next morning, as per company policy. 

![IMG_3085](https://github.com/yanboishere/Chain.Food/assets/76860915/0e17c760-29a0-4f0c-b8b6-2efc5a4323d1)

Affected by the company's policy, although these foods have been sold at a discount,(The food in the picture is less than $1) there are still a lot of surplus.
---

These experiences highlight the issue of food waste in urban areas, and the author was inspired to create a decentralized application (Dapp) called Chain Food to address this problem.

## Food Wasted Data

Data from „ÄäThe Food Waste Index Report„Äã 

by the **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)** 

suggests:

> About 93.1 billion kilograms of food is wasted globally every year, equivalent to 17% of all food produced.

> Vegetables, roots, fruits and grains are the most commonly wasted food types in households.

> Food retailers and foodservice are among the largest sources of food waste, with supermarkets, restaurants and hotels being particularly wasteful links in their supply chains.

> Reducing food waste plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as the energy and resources required to produce, transport and process food result in significant carbon emissions.

The report reveals the magnitude of the food waste problem and calls for global action to reduce it. 

The numbers are astonishing.

And the most important,there's still many people were hunger.

## 828 million people worldwide face hunger
From [2022 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report](https://www.fao.org/publications/home/fao-flagship-publications/the-state-of-food-security-and-nutrition-in-the-world/en)

By the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

These food waste could have been avoided and keep less people hunger...but **why not for reuse before it waste?**

So,This is the main problem that our project aims to solve:

## Partnerships

Chain Food is willing to collaborate with Layer2 service providers to airdrop partnership funds to users in the form of blockchain assets.

## Social Responsibility - Donations

Chain.Food will donate the tax revenue and some of its profits earned from users obtaining [FoodCoin](https://github.com/yanboishere/Chain.Food/blob/master/FoodCoin.md) and minting NFTs to nonprofit organizations dedicated to donating food to underdeveloped regions and disaster-stricken areas in order to help them carry out such activities.

The ultimate goal of the project is to save **at least 500 tons of food waste and complete 10000 food exchange activities** within one year of the platform's launch, while continuing to support other nonprofit organizations. The aim is to make this project sustainable and help feed those who are in need so that they will not experience hunger due to environmental factors.
